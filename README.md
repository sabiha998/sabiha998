Hi, I am Sabiha Sultana Sabiha, currently pursuing a B.A.Sc in Biomedical Engineering from the University of British Columbia. 
I am  joining UBC Orthopaedic Injury and Biomechanics Group as an Undergraducate Research Assistant for Summer 2022 for researching and developing a novel omnidirectional biofidelic surrogate neck (ODN) for automotive crash test dummies and helmet testing.I co-lead a biomedical engineering student design team- UBC Enable, where my team and I build custom assistive technology for clients in the community.
I am a strong advocate to make STEM education accessible for young girls in developing countries. I also enjoy spending time outdoors in nature, listening to music, and audiobooks in my free time.
